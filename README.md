# exploring-bitcoin
A few examples demonstrating how to connect to the Bitcoin blockchain using the bitcoinj Java library.
Examples cover:
* connecting to the Bitcoin network,
* fetching individual blocks,
* enumerating and filtering transactions in a block,
* creating a new wallet,
* checking wallet details,
* downloading the blockchain in order to check the balance of the wallet (default bitcoinj SPV approach using a Bloom filter).

You can find more details in comments in the Java source files.
